XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is a powerful machine learning algorithm based on the gradient boosting framework, which builds an ensemble of decision trees in a sequential manner. It is known for its efficiency, flexibility, and high performance, especially with structured/tabular data.
The provided code uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining 95% of its variance. It then trains an XGBoost classifier with hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to optimize the modelâ€™s performance. The results are evaluated using accuracy, classification report, confusion matrix, and feature importance.
